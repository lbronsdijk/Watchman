========

This repository contains the course code for Watchman. Watchman is a app for tracking your favorite TV Shows. It uses [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com/) API to fetch TV shows and MongoDB database to store shows on a local database. This app runs on Node.Js and uses AngularJs as framework.

Search for a show you like, and a them to your watch list. The homepage gives you a list of the top 10 shows you've added recently. If you have more than one show, you can search for a show on the fly.

Following frameworks has been used:
* Node.Js
* Grunt (watching and minifying (SASS) stylesheet files)
* AngularJs
* MongoDB
* express-generator (simply setting up a javascript application)
